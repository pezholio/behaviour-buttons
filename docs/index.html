                    Achievement points are rewarded for good work, and behaviour

                    This plugged along nicely throughout reception class, then,
                    year one came. And it was a whole different ball game.

                    He racked up 29 behaviour points in not for any sort of major naughtiness,
                    just low level cheekiness and messing around, y’know,
                    the sort of stuff that five year olds do

                    Whether or not I agreed with what the school was doing,
                    I knew I needed to help him get better at school.

                    The first thing that came to mind was a reward chart. We'd tried these before
                    and they kinda worked.

                    We thought we'd give him an achievement point for a good day at school
                    and a behaviour point for a bad day. We’d also give him points for
                    his general behaviour at home. If he got a certain amount of
                    reward points by the end of November (his birthday), he could
                    have a big birthday party with all his friends.

                    Amazon dash buttons (if you don't know) are buttons that Amazon
                    provide to give you a quick way of reordering stuff like washing
                    powder, cat food, razors and (weirdly) play doh.

                    I'd seen blog posts about hacking them before, and thought I'd
                    give it a go

                    I could have two buttons to log metrics in Bothan, in a similar way to how
                    I log the school's points

                    <li>A Raspberry Pi</li>
                    <li>2 Amazon Dash buttons</li>

                  <aside class='notes' data-markdown>
                    I got together all the things I needed.
                    Installed node.js on my Pi, then installed the dependencies
                    And set up my Buttons using the Amazon app (more instructions in the blog)

                    <aside class='notes' data-markdown>
                      The next step was to find the buttons on the network - this
                      script listens for all network traffic and returns the Mac
                      address.

                      When you press the dash button, it wakes up and broadcasts
                      to the network.

                      It was then a case of pressing both buttons and getting their
                      mac address

                    Then, armed with my addresses, I wrote a quick script to test it out

                    boot.

                    This cds into the directory and runs my code, outputting to a log
                    every time the Pi boots

                    There are better ways of doing this, but this suited my purposes

                    Whether it was correlation or causation, after a month or so
                    his behaviour really improved. He racked up the achievement points
                    at home, and he's doing pretty well.
